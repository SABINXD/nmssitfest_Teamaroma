# 🩸 Blood Flow  
### A Blood Donation & Emergency Support Platform 🇳🇵

Blood Flow is a social-impact web platform designed to **connect blood donors with people in need** across Nepal.  
Our goal is simple: **make blood availability fast, transparent, and location-based**, especially during emergencies.

## 🌟 Project Idea

In Nepal, finding blood during emergencies is often difficult and time-consuming.  
This platform helps solve that problem by allowing:

- **Donors** to register their blood group and location
- **Patients or families** to search for donors nearby
- **Emergency cases** to quickly reach available donors

This project focuses on **speed, simplicity, and accessibility**, especially for mobile users.
